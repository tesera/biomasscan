# biomasscan

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `biomasscan` is to provide an easy, programmatic way of computing biomass from a tree list. The functions of this package were designed to mimic the functionality of Natural Resources Canada's online tool, available [here](https://apps-scf-cfs.rncan.gc.ca/calc/en/biomass-calculator). 

## Installation

You can install the development version of `biomasscan` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tesera/biomasscan")
```


## Example

Biomass can be estimated for a single tree, by passing the relevant attributes. For example, for a Jack pine, 15.2 meters tall and with a diameter of 21 centimeters at breast height, we get:

```{r example1}
library(biomasscan)

compute_biomass_single_tree(height = 15.2, diameter = 21, 
                            species = 'Jack pine')
```

As we can see, we get estimates of biomass (in kilograms) for four different components. We can turn this into a wide dataset by passing `wide = TRUE`:

```{r example2}
compute_biomass_single_tree(height = 15.2, diameter = 21, 
                            species = 'Jack pine', wide = TRUE)
```

<!---
What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars, eval = FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
